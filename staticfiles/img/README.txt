For the beautiful authentication pages, please add the following image:

1. Create or download an artisanal-themed background image
2. Name it "auth-bg.jpg" 
3. Place it in this directory (static/img/)

Recommended image characteristics:
- Subtle artisanal/handcrafted theme (e.g., wood textures, natural materials, artisan workshop)
- Light/neutral colors that won't interfere with text readability
- High resolution (at least 1920x1080px)
- Soft focus or blurred effect to ensure text remains readable

Until you add the actual image, the authentication pages will use a gradient background as fallback.
